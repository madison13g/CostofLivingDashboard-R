# Cost-of-living_Dashboard

The app's landing page consists of a sidebar with the name and short description of the dashboard, as well as features to filter the information used in the main graphs. A user may filter by province as well as by city population. The first graph is a barchart illustrating the cost of an item, chosen by the user through a dropdown menu, by city and sorted in ascending order. A scrollbar is avaiable to scroll through all values if necessary. In a different barchart, users may choose which specific cities (through dropdowns) they want to compare the cost of an item of. A scatterplot is built from user's choice of two variables (through dropdowns), allowing the user to compare the relative costs and see which city the data belongs to from a tooltip. 

Stretch goals:
- grouping variables into categories to add filtering option (restaurants, market, leisure, etc)
- adding a plot to compare many specific variables for many specific cities (scatterplot, or bubble chart)
- adding a map of Canada which interactively shows city locations
