# Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct for Cost-of-living Dashboard is easily accessible to group members.  

```Our Team```   
The Cost-of-living Dashboard team is made up of MDS students with a wide range of skills, personalities, and experiences. Because of these differences, when working with team members, this Code of Conduct will help guide your interactions.

```Our Standards```   
Every member of our team has the right to be treated with dignity. The Cost-of-living_Dashboard team is dedicated to ensure all team members know that they are in a safe, inclusive space where there will be no discrimination or judgment. We recognise that we are all still learning, and we are here to help each other learn and grow. It is also a safe space to ask questions without fear of being judged.

## Inappropriate Behavior
(a) Violate or attempt to violate the Cost-of-living_Dashboardâ€™s Code of Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;

(b) Commit a criminal act related to the data scientist's professional services;

(c) Engage in data science involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;

(d) Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to methods of science;

(e) Misuse data science results to communicate a false reality or promote an illusion of understanding;

(f) Edit the work of others without discussing it with them first;

(g) Skip meetings without notifying others;

(h) Unable to finish your task in time without notifying others.

## Consequences
If there are instances of violations of the code of conduct, or if one team member feels there has been an instance of unacceptable behaviour, we will meet as a group and discuss within ourselves, and if further action is needed, we shall report this to our TA and/or professor in exceptional circumstances.
