# Milestone 3 Reflection - Group 8

  At this point, we have translated our milestone 2 dashboard from Python into R. This new R dashboard will have the exact same layout, functionalities, and overall function as the previous one. Some of the feedback from our TA included changing variable names from the ones given (eg. Meal_cheap) to cleaner names (eg. Cheap Meal), grouping variables into categories, implementing a ‘deselect all’ option to parallel with the ‘select all’ option, and implementing a map. The goal is to implement all of this feedback for our milestone 4 submission, in the original Python dashboard. In this R dashboard, we have implemented the ‘deselect all’ option as a checkbox when filtering by provinces. Initially, one of our stretch goals was to include a map in our dashboard, so this feedback has further solidified our hopes to implement one for milestone 4. We had not thought of the idea to group variables into categories, so this is a new idea that we will discuss and aim to include in milestone 4.

  At the beginning of the week, we expected the translation into R from Python to be very manageable and seamless, however, it was anything but. We experienced a learning curve with the new syntax, as we would all agree that we are more comfortable in Python compared R, so it was a bit uncomfortable having to second-guess all of our syntax. Also, there were certain quick tricks in Python that were not necessarily available or as easy in R. For example, the checkboxes option was only about 3 lines of code in Python, and it was relatively simple to implement once reading the documentation, but it was much more difficult in R. Due to these factors, we have decided as a group that we wish to continue building out our dashboard in Python, rather than R, for the final submission, as well as the final presentation and demonstration for the class. Overall, it was a humbling experience, working with an already completed dashboard, and having to, essentially, start from scratch to duplicate it in R. It definitely taught us a lot as a group and as individuals, hoping to become future data scientists.
