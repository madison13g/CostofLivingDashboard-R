# Team Contract

To start off, we want to ensure all team members know that they are in a safe, inclusive space where there will be no discrimination or judgment.

If there are instances of **violations of the code of conduct**, or if one team member feels there has been an instance of **unacceptable behaviour**, we will meet as a group and discuss within ourselves, and if further action is needed, we shall report this to our TA and/or professor in exceptional circumstances.

## Meeting Norms
- **How often will group meetings occur?**
    - A few days before specific deadlines, on an ad hoc basis.
    - When there is an issue among team members.

## Work Norms
- **How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?**
    - We will each rely on each other’s strengths when distributing work in a fair and equal manner, and if another member feels overwhelmed and requests assistance, we will be flexible and willing to lend a hand to each other. 
- **What are the expected work hours for the project?**
    - No specific work hours, but please make sure to finish your tasks one day before the due day so that your team member can review and have discussion with you.
- **Will you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?**
    - Ricky will keep notes of discussions and decisions. 
- **What will be the style of working?**
    - We acknowledge that we are all still learning and we are here to help each other learn and grow, and it is a safe space to ask questions without fear of judgment.
- **What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?**
    - All group members shall try their best when completing tasks, and if they require assistance, all group members will be open to assisting each other to create a high quality output.
- **Any other similar things that govern your working relationships.**
    - Don’t edit the work of other people without discussing it with them first. 
- **Possible workflow of each persons assigned to a specific task, then other persons review work**
    - Do work on branches, merge after final version.
